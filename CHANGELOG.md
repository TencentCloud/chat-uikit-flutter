### Improvements

* The duration for video messages sent from the Web will no longer be displayed, as this type of video message does not contain an accurate video duration.

## 2.0.0

If you are upgrading from version 1.7.0, please refer to the changelog of all 2.0.0-preview versions, ranging from preview.1 to preview.7.

The main feature of this new 2.0.0 version is Desktop Support. Tencent Cloud Chat UIKit now supports all platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, Windows, and macOS, which has resulted in significant changes to the codebase. The UI has been improved to adapt to screens of various widths, with different layouts for both wide and narrow screens.

In addition, there are some significant changes compared to version 2.0.0-preview.7.

### New Features

* Implemented text selection and copying in messages on desktop.
* Added group joining application processing on Desktop.
* Introduced `isAutoReportRead` to `TIMUIKitChatConfig` for controlling read status reporting.

## 2.0.0-preview.7

### New Features

* Added `additionalMessageToolTips` to `ToolTipsConfig`. This new property allows developers to add additional message operation tooltip items, apart from the default ones. The previous `additionalItemBuilder` has been replaced by this new property. With `additionalMessageToolTips`, developers only need to specify the data for the tooltip items, rather than providing a whole widget. This makes usage easier, as you no longer need to worry about the UI display.
* Added `isPreloadMessagesAfterInit` to `TIMUIKitConfig`, allows determines whether TUIKit should preload some messages after initialization for faster message display.

### Improvements

* Message operation menu shows when long-pressing messages will not show if nothing operation item includes and do not use message sticker reaction module.
* Renamed `desktopMessageHoverBar` to `additionalDesktopMessageHoverBarItem` in `TIMUIKitChatConfig` to control only the addition of extra operation items displayed on the hover bar of messages on desktop (macOS, Windows, and desktop version of Web), without affecting the default ones. Previously, it controlled the entire message hover bar, including covering the default items.
* Renamed `showWideScreenModalFunc` to `showDesktopModalFunc` in `TIMUIKitConfig` for better clarity.

* Time Divider on Message List: The default 12-hour display has been changed to a 24-hour display.
* Message translation now targets the language of TUIKit instead of relying on the system language directly. The language of TUIKit can be set as the system language automatically or defined by the user. For more information, please refer to this documentation: https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/52154.

* Eliminated the dependency on `fluttertoast`. All necessary customer reminders are now triggered through the `onTUIKitCallbackListener` info callback in your project. For more information, please see: https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/50054#how-do-i-get-an-api-call-error.2Fflutter-layer-error.2Fpop-up-prompt-message.3F.3Ca-id.3D.22callback.22.3E.3C.2Fa.3E.
* Eliminated other six unnecessary dependency packages to reduce the size and improve performance.
